## COVID-19

It's required that you are vaccinated before coming to the sprint.

We will be staying outside most of the time. We'll be renting a pavilion tent for protection against the sun and the unfortunate droplet of rain. 

The temperature drops to a minimum of 15 C outside during the night so it's possible to have windows open.

Spain takes the pandemic very seriously, make sure to check up to date requirements before traveling.
