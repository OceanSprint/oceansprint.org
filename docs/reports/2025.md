## NixOS Module System Enhancements

**Contributors:** [@mightyiam](https://github.com/mightyiam), [@aforemny](https://github.com/aforemny), [@roberth](https://github.com/roberth), [@hsjobeki](https://github.com/hsjobeki)

- Developed [new WIP `builtins.catchEvalError`](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/12705) for robust error catching, to enable serialisation of evaluated NixOS/home-manager/other configurations.
- Worked on Nixpkgs lib functions for diffing module configurations through deep evaluation using the above.
- Added free-floating definitions via `mkDefinition` [#390983](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/390983)
- Enhanced module introspection capabilities, making `attrsOf` and `submodule` and `listOf` options. This unblocks problems like 'module diffing' or having better LSP support.
  preparing PRs for merging [#390952](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/390952) [#391544](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/391544)


## Nix enhancements

- NixOS/nix [stack overflow is `EvalBaseError` instead of `EvalError`](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/12701)
- [WIP fix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/12717) some NixOS/nix flake error evaluation caching problem
- A new Nix built-in function that provides extra information for use in trace messages `traceWithCallPos` [#127215](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/12715)

## [devenv](https://devenv.sh)

**Contributors:** [@sandydoo](https://github.com/sandydoo), [@domenkozar](https://github.com/domenkozar)

- Prepared devenv 1.5 release, including overlays and enhanced AI generation. [#1776](https://github.com/cachix/devenv/pull/1776)
- Added eval cache busting and telemetry warnings ([#1776](https://github.com/cachix/devenv/pull/1776)).
- Fixed issues related to garbage collection ([#1766](https://github.com/cachix/devenv/pull/1766)).
- Reimplemented development environment activation that results into noticable speedups:
    * Linux: 500ms -> 150ms
    * macOS: 1300ms -> 300ms

## Test Driver improvements

**Contributors:** [@tfc](https://github.com/tfc), [@ma27](https://github.com/ma27), [@bew](https://github.com/bew)

- Improved NixOS test driver assertion errors, streamlining debugging and enhancing clarity ([#390996](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/390996)).
- Developed a module for an SSH backdoor into the VM tests and re-used the breakpoint hook for interactive debugging within VM tests running in the sandbox (PR pending).

    - `GET /api/commit/{commit}/fods` - List all FODs associated with a specific nixpkgs commit hash (with pagination)

## Nix Build Provenance and Supply Chain Security

**Contributors:** [@arianvp](https://github.com/arianvp), [@mschwaig](https://github.com/mschwaig), [@JulienMalka](https://github.com/JulienMalka)

- Released working prototype of [nix-attest](https://github.com/arianvp/nix-attest) for publishing in-toto attestations from GitHub CI.
- Published early prototype of [laut](https://github.com/mschwaig/laut) signature format proposal and tool, for stricter verification of dependency trees, so the community can work on it in public together.
- @mschwaig and @JulienMalka started integrating laut with [lila](https://github.com/JulienMalka/lila) in [this PR](https://github.com/JulienMalka/lila/pull/51).
- @arianvp and @mschwaig discussed how they could link up their work as well.
- @JulienMalka wrote a blog on detecting the [XZ backdoor](https://luj.fr/blog/how-nixos-could-have-detected-xz.html).
- We fixed sigstore python package in nixpkgs: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/391693

## Late binding in `python3Packages`

**Contributors:** [@SomeoneSerge](https://someonex.net), [@collinarnett](https://github.com/collinarnett), [@adisbladis](https://github.com/adisbladis)

- An experiment at instantiating the entirety of `python3Packages` using `pyproject-nix` instead of the current `buildPythonPackage`+`pypa{Build,Install}Hook`
  - The new package set exposes a shim `buildPythonPackage` that moves runtime dependencies from `derivation` to `passthru` and uses pyproject-nix's `resolveBuildSystem`.
  - This way, we can
    - reuse Nixpkgs' recipes that rely on the `buildPythonPackage` interface, but
    - eliminate rebuilds caused by changing runtime dependencies,
    - support "cyclic" dependencies (which only seemed cyclic because we didn't used to distinguish between build- and run-time dependencies at the same layer as upstream python),
    - and resolve multi-tenancy issues such as those caused by major version upgrades in `numpy` and `pydantic`.
- The current progress is tracked in https://github.com/collinarnett/nixpkgs/tree/feat/python-late-binding
    - At the time of writing it's already possible to build e.g. `python312PackagesNG.requests`, but not `python312PackagesNG.mkVirtualEnv { requests = [ ]; }`
    - This still suffers from legacy python's setup hooks leaking into derivations and breaking builds
    - Some derivations assuming implicit `wheel` or `flit-core` native build inputs are still not taken care of
- With this project the contributors also learned more about internals of the Nixpkgs' python ecosystem
- Related work and literature:

## Unbreaking `apache-airflow`

**Contributors:** [@collinarnett](https://github.com/collinarnett)

- Worked towards fixing the build process of apache-airflow and its legacy Flask dependency.

---

## gobuild.nix Development

**Contributors:** [@katexochen](https://github.com/katexochen), [@britter](https://github.com/britter)

- Improved [gobuild.nix](https://github.com/katexochen/gobuild.nix) to provide a local directory that can be used as GOPROXY via file URL instead of linking the source of dependencies into a vendor directory.
- Developed code generation tool for streamlined packaging of Go dependencies. Pointing it to the dependency you want to package, it will generate Nix code for that package and all its dependencies.

---

## Darwin Sandboxing

**Contributors:** [@joshheinrichs-shopify](https://github.com/joshheinrichs-shopify)

- Explored loosening sandbox-exec profiles on Darwin to allow it to be enabled by default; discovered another PR [#12570](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/12570) which addresses similar concerns.

---

## Bashless Activation & Minimal NixOS

**Contributors:** [@nikstur](https://github.com/nikstur), [@blitz](https://github.com/blitz), [@willibutz](https://github.com/willibutz), [@britter](https://github.com/britter)

- Developed `nixos-init` a system for bashless initialization of NixOS. This will be completely opt-in by setting `system.nixos-init.enable = true;`. This, however, still needs a lot of small cleanup to be done all over Nixpkgs.
- Developed kernel patches for EROFS as initrd and general initrd cleanups in the kernel.
- Deduplicated the content of initrd and /nix/store for further space savings, because everything that's already in the initrd doesn't need to be in /nix/store.

---

## Clang-built Linux Kernel

**Contributors:** [@blitz](https://github.com/blitz), [@joshheinrichs-shopify](https://github.com/joshheinrichs-shopify)

- Successfully built kernels with LLVM/Clang ([#390631](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/390631)).
- Addressed issue cross-compiling Cargo from aarch64 -> x86_64.

## A Plumbing meetup for Nix implementations

**Contributors** : [@edef](https://github.com/edef1c), [@roberth](https://github.com/roberth), [@fricklerhandwerk](https://github.com/fricklerhandwerk), [@flokli](https://github.com/flokli), [@raitobezarius](https://github.com/RaitoBezarius)


- Interest for closer cross pollination efforts between the implementations
- Sharing more components like conformance test suites

---

## Last but not least

- **Socionomics panel:**
    - Discussed Nix governance and social structures ([notes](https://pad.lassul.us/1jW44wIGSa6HC3xDQgwyaQ)).
    - Started a section on the "broader ecosystem" on the NixOS homepage, listing reimplementations and inspired projects: https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-homepage/pull/1703
    - Discussed newsletters and revolutionary pamphlets! Perhaps this could be aligned with @a-kenji's Teams' Reports effort?
- **libstore build code cleanup** ([@L-as](https://github.com/L-as)).
- **Pareto Security:** Enabled easy security checks for NixOS users ([@zupo](https://github.com/zupo)).
- **Yarn + Nix Integration:** Enabled yarn package manager to use /nix/store cache ([@adrian-gierakowski](https://github.com/adrian-gierakowski)).
- **keep-sorted in nixpkgs:** Integrated keep-sorted into nixpkgs CI to ensure order in large files ([@katexochen](https://github.com/katexochen))
- **Tests for the Gradle and Maven packages:** Added some nixpkgs tests for Gradle and Maven - the two major build systems for Java/JVM development ([@britter](https://github.com/britter))
