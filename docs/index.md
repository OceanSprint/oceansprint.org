## 🏘️ Accommodation

Once you are approved participant for the sprint, we'll get everyone to a shared communication room to help organize accomodation.

## 🛬 How to get here

The best way to travel is [via a plane to Lanzarote airport](https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-to-lanzarote-arrecife-ace).

It's also possible to fly to other island airports and then take a short flight. Fuertaventura is closest being 30min away with a ferry.

From the Lanzarote airport you can take a taxi to the venue, they have a flat rate and it should be around 20-25 EUR.

[Renting a car](https://autoreisen.com/) is usually quite cheap, around 100-150 eur for the week.
