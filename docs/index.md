## 🏘️ Accommodation

Once you are approved participant for the sprint, we'll get everyone to a shared communication room to help organize accomodation.

Note that the accomodation is not covered by the sprint budget.

If you are planning to come with your family and/or stay longer, [Nejc Zupan](https://twitter.com/nzupan) has written a [remote worker's guide to Lanzarote](https://github.com/zupo/awesome-lanzarote).

## 🛬 How to get here

The best way to travel is [via a plane to Lanzarote airport](https://www.flightconnections.com/flights-to-lanzarote-arrecife-ace).

Flights from other Canary Islands (Tenerife/Gran Canaria) are cheap. Flights from Madrid and Barcelona are even cheaper, around 20 EUR.

From the Lanzarote airport you can take a taxi to the venue, they have a flat rate and it should be around 20-25 EUR.
